## 🔁 REQ/REP (Request/Reply): The Basic Pattern

- **REQ** sends a message and waits for a reply.
    
- **REP** receives a message and sends a reply.
    

> ❗ Problem: REQ/REP is **strictly lockstep** — REQ cannot send another request until it gets a reply.

## 🔄 ROUTER/DEALER: Advanced Async Pattern

### 🤖 ROUTER

- Acts like an async server.
    
- Accepts messages from **multiple DEALERs (or REQs)**.
    
- Keeps track of client identity so it can reply to the right one.
    
- Can **send messages even if not asked**.
    

### 🧠 DEALER

- Acts like an async client.
    
- Can **send multiple messages** without waiting for replies.
    
- Doesn’t block — **fire and forget**.
    
- Needs to match messages with replies on its own.

## 📌 Use Case: Replacing REQ/REP for Concurrency

### Problem with REQ/REP:

- A REQ socket must wait for a response before sending the next request.
    
- A REP socket must respond before receiving the next request.
    
- This creates a **lockstep bottleneck**.

### When to Use ROUTER/DEALER

|Situation|Why Use ROUTER/DEALER|
|---|---|
|Many clients, one async server|ROUTER allows queueing/multiplexing|
|Need to **load balance** requests|DEALER acts like a load-balanced REQ|
|Non-blocking communication|No need to wait for strict reply order|
|Want to handle timeouts / retries|DEALER can retry logic on its own|
|**REQ/REP is too rigid**|ROUTER/DEALER gives low-level control|

## 🧪 Example: ROUTER ↔ DEALER

### Server (ROUTER)

```go
socket, _ := context.NewSocket(zmq.ROUTER)
socket.Bind("tcp://*:5555")

for {
    msg, _ := socket.RecvMessage(0)
    fmt.Println("Received:", msg)
    
    // msg[0] is the identity
    reply := append([]string{msg[0]}, "Response to: "+msg[2])
    socket.SendMessage(reply)
}
```

### Client (DEALER)

```go
socket, _ := context.NewSocket(zmq.DEALER)
socket.Connect("tcp://localhost:5555")
socket.SendMessage("Hello")

reply, _ := socket.RecvMessage(0)
fmt.Println("Reply:", reply)
```

> Note: `msg[0]` is the client identity, `msg[1]` is a delimiter (empty), `msg[2]` is the actual message.

## ✅ TL;DR

- Use **ROUTER/DEALER** when:
    
    - You need **concurrent, async**, non-blocking behavior.
        
    - You want to build a **message broker**, proxy, or server that tracks clients.
        
- **ROUTER** replaces REP with client tracking.
    
- **DEALER** replaces REQ with async messaging.
