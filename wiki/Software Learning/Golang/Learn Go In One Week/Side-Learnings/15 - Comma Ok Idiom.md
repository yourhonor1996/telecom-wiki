This line is **receiving from a channel** and checking if it's **still open**.

---

### 🧠 Line:

```go
case num, ok := <-in:
```

### 🔍 Explanation:

- `num := <-in`: this **receives a value** from the `in` channel.
    
- `ok`: this is a **boolean flag** that tells you **whether the channel is still open**.
    

This pattern is called the **"comma ok idiom"** in Go, and it's commonly used when reading from channels.

---

### 🔧 What it means:

- If a value is successfully received from the channel:
    
    - `ok` will be `true`
        
    - `num` will have the received value
        
- If the channel is **closed and empty**:
    
    - `ok` will be `false`
        
    - `num` will be the **zero value** of the channel’s type
        

---

### ✅ Why it's needed in a `for-select` pattern

Without checking `ok`, you could get into an infinite loop trying to read from a closed channel — this lets you **detect when upstream is finished** and **exit cleanly**.

---

### 💡 Example:

```go
ch := make(chan int)
go func() {
    ch <- 42
    close(ch)
}()

val, ok := <-ch
fmt.Println(val, ok) // 42 true

val, ok = <-ch
fmt.Println(val, ok) // 0 false (channel closed)
```

---

Let me know if you'd like to see what happens if you **don’t check `ok`** — or want a drawing of how the channel closes ripple down the pipeline.


## Other Ways To Detect If a Channel Is Open 

### 🔁 Summary:

- **One variable**:
    
    ```go
    val := <-ch
    ```
    
    → You just get the **value** from the channel.
    
- **Two variables**:
    
    ```go
    val, ok := <-ch
    ```
    
    → You get:
    
    - `val`: the value from the channel
        
    - `ok`: a boolean that is `true` if the channel is **still open**, and `false` if it’s **closed**
        

---

### 📦 Use Case

You use the **two-variable form** when:

- You want to detect if a channel is **closed** (especially in pipelines).
    
- You are looping over a channel manually (not using `for range`).
    

---

### 🧪 Behind the Scenes

```go
val, ok := <-ch
```

This behaves like:

- If the channel is open: `ok == true`, `val == sent value`
    
- If the channel is closed and empty: `ok == false`, `val == zero value` (e.g. 0, "", nil, etc.)
    

---

### ✅ Best Practice

Use two variables when:

```go
for {
    val, ok := <-ch
    if !ok {
        break // channel is closed — stop
    }
    fmt.Println(val)
}
```

Or just use:

```go
for val := range ch {
    fmt.Println(val)
}
```

Which handles the `ok` for you behind the scenes.
