Perfect — let's step into the real power of Go now.

### 🧭 **Step 3 – Support Multiple Clients with Broadcast**

#### 🎯 Goal:

Allow multiple clients to connect and **broadcast messages** to all other connected clients (not just echo back).

---

### 🧠 Go Concepts Involved:

- **Shared state**: You’ll manage a set of all connected clients.
    
- **Channels**: You’ll use a central channel to queue incoming messages and broadcast to all clients.
    
- **Goroutines**: One per client for reading, and another shared goroutine for broadcasting.
    
- **Concurrency safety**: Since multiple goroutines access shared data, you'll guard it using `sync.Mutex` or a dedicated goroutine (actor model).
    

---

### 💡 Design:

1. `type Client` → Represents one connection (WebSocket + outbound channel)
    
2. `hub.go` (optional) → A "Hub" or "Broker" that:
    
    - Tracks all clients
        
    - Receives all messages
        
    - Broadcasts them to everyone
        

---

### ✅ Task:

In your `server/` package, create a minimal hub-based structure.

Start with:

#### 1. Define the `Client` type

```go
type Client struct {
    conn *websocket.Conn
    send chan []byte // outbound messages to this client
}
```

#### 2. Define a global or shared `clients` list and a `broadcast` channel:

```go
var (
    clients   = make(map[*Client]bool) // all connected clients
    broadcast = make(chan []byte)      // messages to broadcast
    mu        sync.Mutex               // protects clients map
)
```

#### 3. Modify your handler to:

- Register the client
    
- Start:
    
    - A goroutine to read from WebSocket and send to `broadcast`
        
    - A goroutine to write from `client.send` to WebSocket
        
- Unregister client on disconnect
    

#### 4. In `main()`, start a goroutine to listen on `broadcast` and forward to all clients

🛑 Don’t worry about advanced error handling or user tracking yet — we’ll do that later.

Try implementing these pieces now — especially:

- `Client` struct
    
- Modified `handler`
    
- `broadcast` loop in `main()`
    

Send me what you've written and I’ll review before we go further.



## Step 3 - 2 
You're on the right track — defining `Client` and the `Hub` is exactly what we want at this stage. Let's do a quick **review** of both and highlight what to fix/improve so you can continue confidently.

---

### ✅ `Client` Struct

Your `Client` type looks good:

```go
type Client struct {
	conn *websocket.Conn
	send chan []byte
}
```

**✅ Tips:**

- Later we’ll use `send` to push outbound messages (written by a writer goroutine).
    
- You might want to add a `Close()` method to help unregister and clean up.

### 🔍 Review of `Hub`

```go
type Hub struct {
	clients   ClientMap
	broadcast chan []byte
	mu        sync.Mutex
}
```

This struct is correct in terms of data modeling.

---

### ❌ Issue in `NewHub()`

```go
func NewHub(clients ClientMap) *Hub {
	return &Hub{nil, nil, sync.Mutex{}}
}
```

You're passing `clients` into the function but not using it. Also, `broadcast` is `nil` — that’ll cause a panic when sending.

---

### ✅ Fix for `NewHub`:

```go
func NewHub() *Hub {
	return &Hub{
		clients:   make(ClientMap),
		broadcast: make(chan []byte),
	}
}
```

---

### ✅ Add a method to run the broadcast loop:

```go
func (h *Hub) Run() {
	for {
		msg := <-h.broadcast
		h.mu.Lock()
		for client := range h.clients {
			select {
			case client.send <- msg:
			default:
				// drop client if unresponsive
				close(client.send)
				delete(h.clients, client)
			}
		}
		h.mu.Unlock()
	}
}
```

---

### ✅ Update `AddClient` (with mutex):

```go
func (h *Hub) AddClient(c *Client) {
	h.mu.Lock()
	defer h.mu.Unlock()
	h.clients[c] = true
}
```

---

### 🧪 Your Next Task:

1. Fix `NewHub()` and `AddClient()` as shown above.
    
2. Add the `Run()` method to continuously forward messages from `broadcast` to all connected clients.
    
3. In your `main.go`, create a `hub := NewHub()` and start `go hub.Run()`.
    
4. Update your handler to:
    
    - Register the new client with `hub.AddClient(client)`
        
    - Start 2 goroutines:
        
        - One to read messages and push to `hub.broadcast`
            
        - One to listen on `client.send` and write to the socket
