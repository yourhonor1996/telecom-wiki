Awesome ðŸš€ â€” this is exactly the kind of end-to-end story that ties all those SS7 layers together.  
Letâ€™s walk step by step through **how an SMS moves from Phone A â†’ Phone B**.

Iâ€™ll break it down into **Network Elements**, **Identifiers**, and **Protocol Layers**.

# ðŸ“¡ SMS Delivery Path: Phone A â†’ Phone B

There are **two directions** in SMS:

- **MO-SMS** = Mobile Originated SMS (A sends â†’ SMSC)
    
- **MT-SMS** = Mobile Terminated SMS (SMSC â†’ B)
    

We need **both flows** to complete an end-to-end message.

---

## ðŸŸ¢ 1. Phone A â†’ SMSC (MO-SMS flow)

1. **Phone A creates SMS**
    
    - User types message, phone encodes it (PDU format).
        
    - Phone decides which SMSC (stored in SIM settings, e.g., +123456789).
        
2. **Radio Access (BTS â†’ BSC â†’ MSC)**
    
    - The phone sends the SMS using **control plane signaling** (not user plane like voice/data).
        
    - Message travels:
        
        ```
        Phone A â†’ BTS (Base Station) â†’ BSC (Base Station Controller) â†’ MSC (Mobile Switching Center)
        ```
        
    - Protocol: **LAPDm / BSSAP / MAP ForwardSM**
        
3. **MSC forwards to SMSC**
    
    - MSC receives SMS and encapsulates it in **MAP MO-ForwardSM**.
        
    - Uses **SS7 stack**:
        
        ```
        MAP â†’ TCAP â†’ SCCP â†’ MTP3 â†’ MTP2 â†’ MTP1
        ```
        
    - SMS is routed (like a packet) to the **SMSC** (Short Message Service Center).
        

âœ… At this point, Phone Aâ€™s job is done. SMS is now stored at the SMSC.

---

## ðŸŸ¢ 2. SMSC â†’ Phone B (MT-SMS flow)

Now the SMSC tries to deliver the message to B.

4. **SMSC queries HLR**
    
    - SMSC must know **where B is currently registered**.
        
    - SMSC sends **MAP SRI-SM (SendRoutingInfo for SM)** to **HLR of Bâ€™s operator**.
        
    - HLR checks:
        
        - Is B a valid subscriber?
            
        - Is B reachable (attached)?
            
        - Which MSC currently serves B?
            
    - HLR replies with **MSC address + IMSI**.
        

---

5. **SMSC sends SMS to MSC**
    
    - SMSC now knows B is at **MSC-B**.
        
    - SMSC sends **MAP MT-ForwardSM** to that MSC.
        
    - Again through SS7:
        
        ```
        MAP â†’ TCAP â†’ SCCP (using IMSI/MSISDN global title) â†’ MTP
        ```
        

---

6. **MSC delivers to Phone B**
    
    - MSC pages Phone B in its area.
        
    - Phone B responds via radio link.
        
    - SMS is sent over **control channel (SDCCH)** down to the handset.
        
    - Phone B acknowledges receipt back to MSC (RP-ACK).
        

---

7. **SMSC gets final acknowledgment**
    
    - MSC forwards the success/failure back to SMSC.
        
    - If B was unreachable (switched off, out of coverage), MSC tells SMSC â†’ SMSC stores and retries later.

# ðŸ”‘ Identifiers Involved

|Identifier|Role|
|---|---|
|**MSISDN** (phone number)|What user dials / sends to|
|**IMSI** (SIM identity)|Used in HLR/MSC lookups|
|**SMSC address**|Phone A sends to this node first|
|**HLR**|Tells SMSC where B is|
|**MSC address**|Final routing node serving B|

# âœ… Key Takeaways

- SMS travels entirely in **control plane signaling**, not the user data plane.
    
- **SMSC is the central store-and-forward hub**.
    
- **SS7 stack layers (MAP, TCAP, SCCP, MTP)** carry all signaling between MSC/HLR/SMSC.
    
- Delivery may be delayed if B is offline; SMSC retries until timeout.

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to **expand this with SIGTRAN (SS7 over IP)** â€” i.e., how the same SMS flow works in modern IP-based core networks â€” so you see how SCTP, M3UA, and IP fit into this?
