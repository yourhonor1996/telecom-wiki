Perfect question üëå ‚Äî SS7 (Signaling System No.7) is one of the **most important foundations** in telecom, especially for SMS, roaming, and interconnect. Let‚Äôs go layer by layer so you can map it to your programming knowledge.

# üì° SS7 (Signaling System No.7) ‚Äì Layered Architecture

SS7 is the **signaling protocol suite** used in GSM and other telephony networks.  
Think of it as the **TCP/IP of telecom**, but instead of carrying user data (voice or SMS content), it carries **control information** like call setup, SMS routing, mobility, and billing.

It has a **layered structure**, similar to the OSI model or TCP/IP stack:

---

![[Pasted image 20250820093100.png]]
## 1. **MTP (Message Transfer Part)**

MTP is like the **IP + TCP/UDP equivalent** in telecom.

It has 3 sublayers:

### üîπ MTP Level 1 (Physical Layer)

- Comparable to OSI Layer 1.
    
- Responsible for **physical transmission** of signaling messages (electrical, optical, or radio).
    
- Example: E1/T1 lines, or IP transport in modern SIGTRAN.
    

---

### üîπ MTP Level 2 (Data Link Layer)

- Like **Data Link layer (Ethernet/PPP)**.
    
- Provides **error detection, error correction, and sequencing** of signaling messages.
    
- Ensures reliable delivery between directly connected signaling points.
    

---

### üîπ MTP Level 3 (Network Layer)

- Like **IP routing**.
    
- Provides **message routing between signaling points** (like routers).
    
- Functions:
    
    - **Message discrimination**: Is this message for me or should I forward it?
        
    - **Message routing**: Which link/path should I use?
        
    - **Message distribution**: Deliver to the correct higher-layer user (e.g., SCCP, ISUP).
        

---

## 2. **SCCP (Signaling Connection Control Part)**

- Think of SCCP as **‚ÄúIP addresses + transport‚Äù** on top of MTP3.
    
- Provides **global addressing** beyond point codes.
    
- Functions:
    
    - **Global Title Translation (GTT)** ‚Üí like DNS: converts IMSI/MSISDN into an actual network address (point code + subsystem).
        
    - Supports both **connectionless** (like UDP) and **connection-oriented** (like TCP) signaling.
        
- Used heavily in **SMS and roaming**.
    

---

## 3. **TCAP (Transaction Capabilities Application Part)**

- Think of it as **‚Äúsessions‚Äù or ‚Äútransactions‚Äù**, like an API session.
    
- Allows applications (like HLR, VLR, SMSC) to exchange multiple request/response operations in one logical dialog.
    
- Comparable to **RPC (Remote Procedure Call)** in programming.
    

Example:

- MSC asks HLR: ‚ÄúWhere is subscriber IMSI=123?‚Äù
    
- HLR responds with routing info.  
    That whole exchange is a **TCAP transaction**.
    

---

## 4. **MAP (Mobile Application Part)**

- This is the **application layer for mobile networks**.
    
- Runs **on top of TCAP**.
    
- Provides the actual **mobile services logic**:
    
    - Location management (HLR ‚Üî VLR)
        
    - Authentication (HLR ‚Üî AuC)
        
    - SMS routing and delivery (MSC ‚Üî SMSC ‚Üî HLR)
        
    - Roaming procedures
        

Example:

- `SendRoutingInfoForSM` (SRI-SM) ‚Üí MAP operation to find out which MSC a subscriber is currently on.
    

---

## 5. **ISUP (ISDN User Part)** (not SMS-related, but core to SS7)

- Used for **call setup, management, and teardown** in circuit-switched telephony.
    
- Example: when you dial a number, ISUP sets up the call path between switches.
    

---

## 6. **Other User Parts**

- **TUP (Telephone User Part)** ‚Äì older voice signaling (pre-ISUP).
    
- **INAP (Intelligent Network Application Part)** ‚Äì for prepaid, toll-free, and advanced services.

‚úÖ So when you send an SMS:

- MAP operation (`ForwardSM`) ‚Üí
    
- carried inside TCAP transaction ‚Üí
    
- routed via SCCP (using IMSI/MSISDN lookup) ‚Üí
    
- delivered across MTP (signaling network).
