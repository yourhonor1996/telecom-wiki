üëâ Would you like me to **map a learning roadmap (step-by-step plan)** for you, showing how you can move from your current programming background into becoming strong in telecom (say, 6‚Äì12 months path)?

# What The Company Does
From what you‚Äôre saying:

- The company **sits between ISPs/operators**.
    
- It **routes SMS messages across networks**.
    
- It provides an **application/service layer** that ensures messages from Operator A can be delivered to Operator B‚Äôs subscribers.
    

This places the company in the **telecom interconnection & messaging services domain**, more specifically:

---

## üìå Relevant Telecom Domains

1. **Interconnect & Wholesale Carrier Services**
    
    - This is the business of connecting different operators so traffic (voice, SMS, data) can flow between them.
        
    - Companies in this space act as **interconnect hubs** or **carriers‚Äô carriers**.
        
2. **SMS Aggregation / SMS Hubbing**
    
    - What you described matches **SMS Aggregators** or **SMS Hubs**.
        
    - They don‚Äôt own end subscribers but enable **A2P (Application-to-Person)** and **P2P SMS traffic** across networks.
        
    - Example: when a bank sends you an OTP SMS, it often goes through an aggregator, not directly from the bank‚Äôs telecom provider.
        
3. **Messaging Middleware**
    
    - The company‚Äôs **application** that routes SMS is essentially a **middleware** system.
        
    - It typically implements **SS7 / SMPP / Diameter / SIP** protocols to talk to different ISPs‚Äô Short Message Service Centers (SMSCs).
        

---

## üõ† Technologies Involved

- **Protocols**:
    
    - SMPP (Short Message Peer-to-Peer) ‚Üí the standard for SMS routing
        
    - SS7 (legacy signaling)
        
    - Diameter (for LTE/IMS networks)
        
- **Applications**:
    
    - SMS routers, gateways, hubs
        
    - Billing & settlement systems (since interconnection involves cost sharing)
        

---

## üéØ So, what field are they in?

They‚Äôre operating in the **telecom value-added services (VAS) / interconnect services** domain, with a focus on **SMS aggregation and inter-operator messaging**.

This is not core ‚Äúradio access‚Äù (like building base stations) but rather **core network / service layer** business ‚Äî the layer that makes sure telecom operators can exchange messages reliably and profitably.

üëâ Do you want me to sketch a **career knowledge map** for you, tailored to this company‚Äôs area (SMS interconnect, signaling, aggregation), so you know what to learn to be most valuable there?

# Extended Knowledge Base ‚Äì SMS / Interconnect Domain

## üîπ 1. **SS7 Signaling Stack & Layers**

SS7 (Signaling System No.7) is the backbone of legacy/mobile signaling. For SMS and interconnect, these layers are crucial:

- **MAP (Mobile Application Part)**
    
    - Application layer used for mobility & SMS services (e.g., SMS routing, roaming).
        
    - Example: SRI-SM (Send Routing Info for SMS).
        
- **TCAP (Transaction Capabilities Application Part)**
    
    - Provides transaction-oriented communication (sessions) between applications in different nodes.
        
    - Used by MAP to manage dialogs.
        
- **SCCP (Signaling Connection Control Part)**
    
    - Provides global addressing (Global Title Translation, routing messages by phone number/IMSI).
        
- **MTP3 / M3UA**
    
    - **MTP3** (Message Transfer Part Level 3) in classic SS7.
        
    - **M3UA** (MTP3 User Adaptation Layer) for carrying SS7 over IP (in SIGTRAN).
        
- **SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol)**
    
    - Transport layer protocol used in SIGTRAN for reliable delivery over IP.
        
- **IP**
    
    - Bottom layer when SS7 signaling is carried over IP networks.
        

üìå Together, MAP ‚Üí TCAP ‚Üí SCCP ‚Üí M3UA ‚Üí SCTP ‚Üí IP is how an SMS signaling message can travel over modern IP backbones.

## üîπ 2. **Key GSM Core Network Elements**

Understanding where SMS travels inside GSM:

- **BTS (Base Transceiver Station)**
    
    - The ‚Äúcell tower‚Äù handling radio communication with mobile phones.
        
- **MSC (Mobile Switching Center)**
    
    - Core switch that connects calls and SMS, routes to other operators, and interfaces with SMSC.
        
- **HLR (Home Location Register)**
    
    - Database storing subscriber info (IMSI, MSISDN, services allowed).
        
- **VLR (Visitor Location Register)**
    
    - Temporary subscriber data store for roaming users (local to an MSC).
        

---

## üîπ 3. **Subscriber & Routing Identifiers**

- **IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity)**
    
    - Unique identifier of a SIM/subscriber.
        
- **MSISDN**
    
    - The actual phone number.
        
- **SRI (Send Routing Info)**
    
    - MAP procedure where one network queries another‚Äôs HLR to know where to deliver an SMS.
        
    - Result: gives back the IMSI + serving MSC address.
        
- **MSC Address**
    
    - Needed to forward the SMS to the correct network entity.
        

---

## üîπ 4. **SMS Procedures**

- **Submit**
    
    - Action where the **mobile phone (MS) or an external app** sends an SMS to the network (towards SMSC).
        
- **Deliver**
    
    - Action where the **SMSC sends the SMS onward** (to the recipient MS or another operator).
        

This distinction (Submit vs Deliver) is core to understanding SMPP commands (`submit_sm`, `deliver_sm`).

---

## üîπ 5. **SMPP (Short Message Peer-to-Peer)**

- Protocol for exchanging SMS between applications and SMSCs (over TCP/IP).
    
- Used by **aggregators, hubs, enterprises** to submit and receive SMS at scale.
    
- Key PDU operations:
    
    - `submit_sm` ‚Üí send an SMS
        
    - `deliver_sm` ‚Üí deliver SMS or delivery report
        
    - `enquire_link` ‚Üí keep the connection alive
        

---

## üîπ 6. **GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications)**

- 2G mobile standard, still widely used for voice and SMS.
    
- Defines architecture: BTS ‚Üî BSC ‚Üî MSC, with HLR/VLR/AC (Authentication Center).
    
- SMS in GSM flows **via control plane signaling** (not a separate channel).
    

---

## üîπ 7. **SIGTRAN (Signaling Transport over IP)**

- Family of protocols enabling SS7 over IP networks.
    
- Key layers:
    
    - **SCTP** (transport)
        
    - **M3UA** (adapts SS7 MTP3 to IP)
        
- Purpose: migrate from traditional TDM-based SS7 to IP-based signaling while keeping compatibility.
    

---

‚úÖ With these terms included, your knowledge base now covers the **end-to-end flow of an SMS**:

1. Mobile submits ‚Üí BTS ‚Üí MSC ‚Üí SMSC.
    
2. If recipient is on another network: SRI query ‚Üí HLR ‚Üí IMSI & MSC.
    
3. Message routed via SS7/SIGTRAN stack (MAP over TCAP/SCCP/M3UA/SCTP/IP).
    
4. Delivered to recipient (Deliver).
    

---

üëâ Next step: I can **design your weekly roadmap** (bootcamp style) so you learn these concepts progressively. For example:

- Week 1‚Äì2: GSM architecture (BTS, MSC, HLR, VLR, Submit/Deliver)
    
- Week 3‚Äì4: SS7/SIGTRAN stack layers (MAP, TCAP, SCCP, M3UA, SCTP)
    
- Week 5‚Äì6: SMPP hands-on (write client in Python, capture traffic in Wireshark)
    
- Week 7‚Äì8: Routing logic, SRI procedures, number portability
    

Do you want me to lay out that **8-week roadmap** step by step with projects you can code along?
